        <h3>Pythonic Code</h3>
        <p>A common term in the Python community is <em>pythonic</em>. Code that is pythonic is code that takes advantage of the special features and idioms of the Python language. Code that looks like a rough transcription from another language is often called unpythonic. If you become a Python programmer, you'll want to learn how to code pythonically, so that others can understand your code, and so that you can understand others' code. One of the most important (but tricky) pythonic code concepts is the <b>list comprehension</b>, which can be used in place of the <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> HoFs.
        <p>While <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code> work, most members of the Python community consider them less pythonic than list comprehensions. -->

        <h3>List Comprehensions</h3>
        <p>
          One of the most important (but tricky) Python concepts is the <b>list comprehension</b>, which can act almost indistinguishably from the <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code> HoFs.

        </p>
        <h3>Map in Python</h3>
        <p>
            First, let's discuss how list comprehensions can be used to emulate the <code>map</code> HoF. An example is given below:

        <table style="width:80%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre><code>
>>> my_list = [1, 2, 3]
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/set_my_list_snap.png"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <table style="width:80%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre><code>
>>> [x * x for x in my_list]
[1, 4, 9]
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/snap_map_square.png"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            <code>[x * x for x in my_list]</code> may look very strange at first, but once you've used this idea a few times, you'll realize it's quite powerful. While a bit alien, we can see that Python code using comprehensions is still somewhat similar to the Snap<em>!</em> code. The differences are:
        </p>
        <p><ul>
            <li>
            Instead of having a multiply function with two blanks, we have <code>x * x</code>
            </li>
            <li>Instead of passing my_list as an argument we use something that resembles a for loop: <code>for x in my_list</code>.
            </li>
            <!--<li>Instead of explicitly calling the <code>map</code> function we are now using a special purpose syntax used specifically for mapping functions over lists.
            </li>-->
        </ul>
        </p>
            Despite these syntactic differences, the net result is exactly the same: We multiply each element of <code>my_list</code> by itself, producing the effect of squaring each number. And like the <code>map</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>, we produce a new list without changing the original list.
        </p>
        <p>
            The syntax for a <b>list comprehension</b> is as follows:
        <p><pre><code>
>>> [function(x) for x in my_list]
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>This syntax can be confusing at first because it looks like we're writing a for loop on one line inside of a list. Don't be fooled! This isn't actually a for loop at all, but instead special syntax that cosmetically resembles a for loop. Again, list comprehensions look weird, but they'll make more sense once you start using them.
        </p>

        <h3>Keep in Python</h3>
        <p>
            List comprehensions are used to do <code>keep</code> as well. An example of using a comprehension to keep items is shown below.
        </p>
        <table style="width:80%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre><code>
>>> my_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9]
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/longer_my_list.png"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <table style="width:80%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre><code>
>>> [x for x in my_list if x < 3]
[1, 1, 2]
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/keep_less_than3.png"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            More generally, if we want to keep only items corresponding to some predicate, we'd use the following. Keep in mind that a predicate is simply a function that returns <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> [x for x in my_list if predicate(x)]
        </code></pre></p>
        <h3>Using List Comprehensions for Map and Keep Simultaneously</h3>
        <p>
            List comprehensions can be used to perform map and keep at the same time. We've also seen how to do this in Snap<em>!</em>, as shown to the right. Observe that the list comprehension is more concise.
            <!--Many experienced programmers find list comprehensions to be generally more concise and easier to read than code that uses HoFs like <code>map</code> and <code>keep</code>, and thus comprehensions are considered more Pythonic.-->
        </p>
        <table style="width:80%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre><code>
>>> my_list = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9]
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/longer_my_list.png"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <table style="width:80%">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <pre><code>
>>> [x + 5 for x in my_list if x <  3]
[6, 6, 7]
                    </code></pre>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/python/map_with_keep.png"/>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Exercise 3.1: Squares of Evens</h3>
        <p>
            Write the function <code>squares_of_evens</code> that takes as input a list of numbers, and returns a list that is equal to the squares of all even numbers. Use list comprehensions.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> squares_of_evens([-5, -2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 8])
[4, 0, 16, 64]
        </code></pre></p>

        <h3>Exercise 3.2: Nth Power of Evens</h3>
        <p>
            Write the function <code>nth_power_of_evens</code> that takes as input an integer n as well as a list of numbers, and returns a list that is equal to the nth power of all even numbers in the list. As before, use list comprehensions.
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> nth_power_of_evens([-5, -2, 0, 1, 3, 4, 8], 3)
[-8, 0, 64, 512]
        </code></pre></p>
