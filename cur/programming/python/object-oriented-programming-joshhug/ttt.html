    <h1>TicTacToe Class Description</h1>
    <p>
        The <code>TicTacToe</code> class represents a standard Tic Tac Toe game. The game consists of a 3x3 board where
        two players, typically represented as "X" and "O", take turns marking the spaces in a grid. The player who
        succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
    </p>

    <p>
        To win in Tic Tac Toe, a player must have three of their symbols (either <code>X</code> or <code>O</code>) consecutively in a row. This can be achieved in the following ways:
    </p>
    
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Condition</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Horizontal</td>
            <td>
                - Top row<br>
                - Middle row<br>
                - Bottom row
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Vertical</td>
            <td>
                - Leftmost column<br>
                - Middle column<br>
                - Rightmost column
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Diagonal</td>
            <td>
                - From top-left to bottom-right<br>
                - From top-right to bottom-left
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Methods to Implement</h2>
    <p>Students are required to implement the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>do_move</code>: Make a move on the board</li>
            <li><code>is_valid_move</code>: Check if a move is valid</li>
            <li><code>check_game_over</code>: Check if the game is over</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Once these methods are implemented correctly, the <code>play_game</code> function will allow you to play a
        complete game of Tic Tac Toe in the console.
    </p>

    <h2>Explanation of the Double For Loop List Comprehension</h2>
    <p>
        The list comprehension used to initialize the board is a concise way to create a 3x3 grid with all spaces
        empty. The outer loop iterates through the rows, and the inner loop iterates through the columns.
    </p>
    <code>[[self.EMPTY for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]</code>
    <p>
        This double for-loop list comprehension creates a list of three lists, where each inner list contains three
        EMPTY spaces, effectively creating a 3x3 grid.
    </p>

    <p>This can be equivalently expressed using two nested for loops:</p>
        <pre><code>
        board = []
        for _ in range(3):
            row = []
            for _ in range(3):
                row.append(self.EMPTY)
            board.append(row)
        </code>
    </pre>


    <h2>Instructions to Play</h2>
    <p>
        Once the three methods are implemented, you can run the <code>play_game()</code> function to start the game.
        Players will be prompted to input their moves in the format of row and column separated by a space. The game
        will continue until a player wins or all cells are filled, resulting in a tie.
    </p>
    <p>Good luck and have fun implementing and playing Tic Tac Toe!</p>
