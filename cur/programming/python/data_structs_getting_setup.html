        <h3>Starter File</h3>
        <p>
            Refer to the previous lab for instructions on how to open and use a shell application (terminal for Mac/Linux users and the CMD command prompt for Windows users).  Once you have a shell up and running, <code>cd</code> into the directory that contains the <a href="../../../prog/python/lab2starter.py"">starter file</a> you have downloaded at the beginning of the lab. Make sure you are completing all of the exercises in the starter code file. You will submit it to Gradescope to receive credit for this lab. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You can test your functions as you go by running <code>python3 -m doctest lab2starter.py</code> in the directory that contains the starter code file.
        </p>
        <h3>Exercise 1: Push First Odd Back</h3>
        <p>
            Fill out the function <code>push_first_odd_back</code> under exercise 1 in the starter file.  This function should place the first odd number at the back of the input list. Do not return a new list - in fact this function shouldn't return anything, it should only modify the input list (remember when we talked about mutability a few pages back?).
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
>>> lst = [10, 2, 4, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> push_first_odd_back(lst)
>>> lst
[10, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 7]
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            To test this function, run:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code class="bash">
python3 -m doctest lab2starter.py
        </code></pre></p>
        <!-- Held to shorten lab
        <h3>Challenge Exercise 1: merge</h3>
        <p>
            Write the function <code>merge</code>, found in the challenge exercise section of the starter file.  This should recursively merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list.  To test this function enter:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
python3 PythonLab2.py C1
        </code></pre></p>
        <h3>Challenge Exercise 1b: recursive push_first_odd_back</h3>
        <p>
            Rewrite your <code>push_first_odd_back</code> so that it is recursive. Hint: You'll need a helper function. Hint #2: Your helper function will need two inputs: a list and an index.
        </p>
