        <p>Your ultimate goal is to write a function build_markov_model(text, k) that generates a dictionary representation of a Markov Chain of order k for the given text. For example, <code>build_markov_model("the ether")</code> will return <code>{' et': {'h': 1}, 'the': {' ': 1, 'r': 1}, 'e e': {'t': 1}, 'he ': {'e': 1}, 'eth': {'e': 1}}</code>. Note that this is just a dictionary representation of our table from the previous page:
<pre>                frequency of           probability that
                 next char             
kgram   freq         e   h   r   t   
-------------------------------------
 the      2      1   0   0   1   0    
 he       1      0   1   0   0   0    
 e e      1      0   0   0   0   1   
  et      1      0   0   1   0   0   
 eth      1      0   1   0   0   0   
 her      1      0   0   0   0   1   
 ert      1      0   0   1   0   0   
 rth      1      0   1   0   0   0</pre>        
        </p>
        <p>
        To reach this goal, let's take things one step at a time. Let's start by filling out the get_kgram function. Test it to your satisfaction with the autograder before proceeding.
        </p>

<pre>
<code>def get_kgram(text, ptr, k):
    """Returns the kgram starting at position ptr in a text. For example:

    get_kgram("hello", 0, 3) would return "hel"
    get_kgram("hello", 1, 3) would return "ell"
    get_kgram("hello", 1, 4) would return "ello"
    get_kgram("hello", 3, 4) would crash since 3 + 4 is longer than the string."""</code></pre>
 
    <pre><code>$ python autograder.py get_kgram</code></pre>

<h3>Adding a Single Character to our Model</h3>

<p>Next we'll create a function that adds single characters to our model. Fill in the following function:</p>

<pre>
<code>def process_character(m, text, ptr, k):
    """Adds information about the given character to the model

    m is the model (a dictionary)
    text is the text
    text[ptr] is the character to be processed
    k is the order of our Markov chain"""</code></pre>

<p>For example, consider what happens if we want to build a markov model of "the ether". Suppose our markov model is stored in a variable called <code>markovmodel</code> and we have k = 4. After we've processed the first three characters, <code>markovmodel = {'the ': {'e': 1}, 'he e': {'t': 1}, 'e et': {'h': 1}}</code>. To process the next character, we'd call <code>process_character(markovmodel, "the ether", 3, 4)</code>. Make sure you understand this before proceeding!</p>

<p>Write the <code>process_character</code> function. Test it with the following code and make sure your output matches the output given in the example in the paragraph above.
</p>

<pre>
<code>markovmodel = {}
process_character(markovmodel, "the ether", 0, 4)
process_character(markovmodel, "the ether", 1, 4)
process_character(markovmodel, "the ether", 2, 4)
</code></pre>

 <p> You can test your code with the autograder as well by running:
</p>
    
<pre><code>$ python autograder.py process_character</code></pre>

<h3>Building our Markov Model</h3>

<p>Now we have all the functions we need to build a markov model from a corpus of text! Fill in build_markov_model:</p>

<pre>
<code>def build_markov_model(text, k):
    """ Returns the markov model for text.
    m is the model (a dictionary)
    text is the text
    k is the order of our Markov chain"""</code></pre>

<p> This function should loop through text, process each character and add it to the model accordingly. For example calling <code>build_markov_model('the ether', 3)</code> would <code>return {' et': {'h': 1}, 'the': {' ': 1, 'r': 1}, 'e e': {'t': 1}, 'he ': {'e': 1}, 'eth': {'e': 1}}</code>.</p>

<p class="alert quoteBlue">
Hint: Use the process_character function in your implementation of build_markov_model</code>.
 </p> 

<p> You can check your work with the autograder:
</p>

<pre><code>$ python autograder.py build_markov_model</code></pre>
