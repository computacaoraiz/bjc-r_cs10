    <p>We will be working off of a really simple and well known game, TicTacToe. One thing any game must have is a game
        loop to ensure that the game does not end until a game-ending condition (or conditions) is met. In Tic Tac Toe,
        there are 3 such conditions: Player 1 wins, Player 2 wins, or no player wins and there are no moves left.</p>
    <p>Before we build the game loop, we must import all our libraries and classes that we may need for our game to run.
        We will also need to define some variables for later use and initialize pygame so that our game can run
        properly. The difference between variables we define now vs variables we define later while the game loop is
        running is that variables defined outside of the game loop will be needed to start the game. These variables may
        or not change later when we run the actual game, but we are going to need them before we start even playing the
        game. Below are the variables we are defining and why they are defined here instead of inside the game loop:</p>
    <p># importing needed libraries and classes
        import pygame as pg
        import random
        import os
        from ttt_classes import Game
        from ttt_classes import Player
        ​
        # initialize the pygame library
        pg.init()
        ​
        # Screen size will be needed to initiate the screen, which needs to happen to display the game Screen
        screen = pg.display.set_mode([300, 300])
        ​
        # we do not want to be creating new players everytime the game loop runs, we only want to be creating two
        players that will stay the same as the game runs Players
        player1 = Player("x")
        player2 = Player("o")
        ​
        # This code contains our game functions along with our game board. It essentially the heart of the game. WE only
        need one instance of this because we are only playing one game
        ttt_game = Game(player1, player2)</p>
    <p>Now we can move onto the game loop. To build the game loop, we will be using a while loop as the base. Remember
        that the game loop runs until one of the game-ending conditions is met. To accomplish this, we will set a
        variable called running equal to True before we start the game loop. The game loop will run while running ==
        True When one of the game-ending conscious is met, we will set running == False to exit out of our while loop.
    </p>
    <p>running = True
        while running:
        # do game stuff
        If game-ending condition == True
        running = False
        # do more game stuff
        ​
        # game ends when while loop breaks</p>
    <p>The next thing we need to do is listen for events in python. Events are essentially actions that the players do
        that affect the game. Usually, this is a mouse click, keyboard input, or on-screen button press of some sort. In
        ttt, there are two types of events we want to listen for: Quitting the game, and a mouse click. For quitting the
        game, if the quitting event is ever triggered, we simply want to stop running the game. To do this, we would
        just set running = False.</p>
    <p>When a player clicks on the board, they will be placing their ttt piece. We will go through how the game handles
        a click later, but for now, we will leave the area empty.</p>
    <p>running = True
        while running:
        ​
        for event in pg.event.get():
        # handling the event where player exits out of pygame window
        if event.type == pg.QUIT:
        running = False
        # handling event where player clicks on the board
        if event.type == pg.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
        #do stuff with the mouse coordinates
        ​
        ​
        ​
        if game-ending condition == True
        running = False
        ​
        # do more game stuff
        ​
        # game ends when while loop breaks</p>
    <p>The next part of the game loop is checking the game-ending conditions. Remember that we have 3 we want to check
        for. We will use two if statements to check our three conditions. The first condition will simply check if any
        player has one. This means that we are looking for if player 1 or player 2 has won the game. The second
        condition checks whether or not a tie has occurred. In ttt, a tie has occurred if there are no moves left and no
        one was won yet. Because we are already checking if there is a winner in the first if condition, we will not
        need to check that condition again to see if there is a tie. We will only need to check if there are no moves
        left. The structure of the code is outlined below, we will replace the if conditions with actual code later in
        the module.</p>
    ​
    <pre><code>
running = True
while running:
​
    for event in pg.event.get():
        # handling the event where player exits out of pygame window
        if event.type == pg.QUIT:
            running = False
        # handling event where player clicks on the board
        if event.type == pg.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            #do stuff with the mouse coordinates
​
​
​
    if ttt_game.cur_player_win() == True:
        running = False
    elif ttt_game.no_moves_left() == True:
        running = False
​
    # do more game stuff
​
# game ends when while loop breaks</code></pre>
    ​
    <p>Many games have “records” that may need to be updated. This includes things like scores or hidden values not seen
        by the player. Usually, an update function is called towards the end of the code to deal with this record
        keeping. Ttt does not really have any records that need to be kept. But we will include an empty update function
        in the game code anyways so you don't forget!</p>
    ​
    <p>Another function that is called at the end of each game loop is a draw function. This function will draw the
        board based on the board representation in the game class. Every time the game loop runs, we draw everything
        that is on the board. You might think that this is awfully tedious and that in games with a lot of animation,
        this might lead to laggy animation.</p>
    <p>Here is the final skeleton for our game loop:</p>

    <pre><code>
running = True
while running:
​
    for event in pg.event.get():
        # handling the event where player exits out of pygame window
        if event.type == pg.QUIT:
            running = False
        # handling event where player clicks on the board
        if event.type == pg.MOUSEBUTTONUP:
            #do stuff with the mouse coordinates
​
​
​
    if ttt_game.cur_player_win() == True:
        running = False
    elif ttt_game.no_moves_left() == True:
        running = False
​
    # do more game stuff
​
    ttt_game.update()
    ttt_game.draw()
​
# game ends when while loop breaks</code></pre>
    ​
    <p>Once you have the skeleton of the loop done, you can now start to build your game. We suggest doing this in a
        separate python file that you can import to the main python file of the skeleton loop.</p>
    <p>The first thing you need to do is create instances of the game that you can readily update during the loop. Does
        this sound familiar? Object Oriented Programming is a great way to define a game object that has certain
        attributes (such as board, players, etc.) that you can update.</p>
    <p>What we’ve done in the ttt_classes.py file is create a class defined as ‘Game’ where each instance of a game will
        have a board (which is a list), player1, player2, and the current turn.</p>
    ​
    <pre><code>
    def __init__(self, player1, player2, board = [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]):
       self.board = board
       self.curr_turn = player1.piece
       self.p1 = player1
       self.p2 = player2
    </code></pre>
    ​
    <p>Now that we have a game to work with, we can define the different functions we’ll need in order to update the
        board and the game.</p>
    <p>The first function we should define is an update function that lets you change the current turn to the next
        player’s turn.</p>
    <pre><code>
    def update(self):
       if self.curr_turn == self.p1.piece:
           self.curr_turn = self.p2.piece
       else:
           self.curr_turn = self.p1.piece</code></pre>
    ​
    <p>Next, we defined a game_click function that changes the board list when a user clicks on an empty block. Remember
        that our board is represented as a list (index 0) as shown below:</p>
    <pre><code>
 #        0 | 1 | 2
 #       -----------
 #        3 | 4 | 5
 #       -----------
 #        6 | 7 | 8  </code></pre>
    ​
    <p>For example, if the user clicks on the area that index 3 is covering and it is empty, the object at index 3 of
        the board list will change from None to the current player’s piece. The index is derived from an equation based
        on the display of the actual game.</p>
    <pre><code>
    def game_click(self, x, y):
       length = 300
       piece = self.curr_turn
       index = ((y * 3) + x ) / (length / 3)
       if (self.board[index] == None):
           self.board[index] = piece </code></pre>
    ​
    <p>Draw_board is a function that draws the current board. It is called in the game loop after the board gets update
        to show a visualization of the game. Remember that game_click and update only changes the python variables and
        not the actual pygame board. Draw_board is in charge of updating the actual display of the game.</p>
    <pre><code>
    def draw_board(self):
       #credit: https://dev.to/ramakm/a-simple-python-tic-tac-toe-game-using-pygame-1l8b
       length = 300
       rows = 3
       gameboard = pygame.display.set_mode((length, length))
       pygame.display.set_caption("")
  
       # Colors
       white = (255, 255, 255)
       black = (0, 0, 0)
  
       # Images
       X_IMAGE = pygame.transform.scale(pygame.image.load("Images/x.png"), (150, 150))
       O_IMAGE = pygame.transform.scale(pygame.image.load("Images/o.png"), (150, 150))
      
       gap = length // rows
  
       #Drawing Board LInes
       for i in range(rows):
           x = i * gap
  
           pygame.draw.line(gameboard, WHITE, (x, 0), (x, WIDTH), 3)
           pygame.draw.line(gameboard, WHITE, (0, x), (WIDTH, x), 3)
  
       center_coordinates = [[50, 50], [150, 50], [250, 50], [50, 150], [150, 150], [250, 150], [50, 250], [150, 250], [250, 250]]
      
       for i in range(len(self.board)):
           if self.board[i] == 'x':
               x = center_coordinates[i][0]
               y = center_coordinates[i][1]
               gameboard.display(X_IMAGE, (x, y))
           if self.board[i] == 'o':
               x = center_coordinates[i][0]
               y = center_coordinates[i][1]
               gameboard.display(O_IMAGE, (x, y)) </code></pre>
    <p>The last two functions end the game. Both functions return a boolean value.
        The function curr_player_win checks if the current player has a winning triple. If the current player has a
        winning triple, then they win.</p>
    <pre><code>
    def curr_player_win(self):
       winning_triples = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 4, 8], [2, 5, 8], [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 4, 6], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]
       piece = self.curr_turn
       for triple in a winning_triples:
           if (self.board[triple[0]] == piece) and (self.board[triple[1]] == piece) and (self.board[triple[2]] == piece):
               return True
       return False </code></pre>
    ​
    <p>No_moves_left checks if there are any places left to place a piece on the board. If there are still empty spaces
        on the board (None values in the board list), the game is still in play.</p>
    ​
    <pre><code>
    def no_moves_left(self):
       if None in self.board:
           return False
       return True </code></pre>
    <p>The remaining class, Player simply instantiates a player with either the piece “x” or “o”.</p>
    ​
    <pre><code>
class Player:
   def __init__(self, xo):
       self.piece = xo </code></pre>
