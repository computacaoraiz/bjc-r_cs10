			Our goal is to draw a tree like this:
			<br>
		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/real-tree.jpg" alt="" title="There should be an image here" >

		<p>
			but we'll start with a simpler version that shows the technique clearly, although less prettily:

		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/normal-recursive-tree-BYOB.jpg" alt="" title="" >
		<br>

		<p>
			The key to understanding this technique is to see that the tree is a <i>fractal,</i> that is, a picture that contains smaller versions of itself:
			<br>
		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/split-recursive-tree-BYOB.jpg" alt="" title="" >
		<p>
			We're going to create a <code>tree</code> block in Snap<em>!</em>. It'll start with a <code>move</code> block to draw the trunk of the tree, then a <code>turn</code> block turning left, <i>then a <code>tree</code> block</i> to draw the left smaller tree, and so on.
		</p>
		<p>
			<!-- "Wait!" you're probably thinking. "How can we use a <code>tree</code> block inside a <code>tree</code> block? It doesn't exist yet!" That's the big idea for this assignment. -->
			Recursion allows us to use the <code>tree</code> block inside a <code>tree</code> block. This is the big idea for today's lab.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're going to work up to the complicated tree starting with very simple steps (numbered below and on the next page).
		</p>
		<p>
			1. Make a <code>tree1</code> block (so named because it draws just one level of the tree) using this script: <br>
		</p>
		<img class="center" title="There should be an image here" alt="" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/tree1.png" >


		<p>
			This looks ridiculously simple, but trust us, it'll get interesting soon. When run, the script draws one tree branch, <i>and then moves the sprite back
            to its original position.</i> That's going to be really important when we start using scripts within scripts; we always want to be able to assume that our
            tree blocks leave the sprite in the same position and direction as it started in.
		</p>
		<p>
			2. <strong>Point the sprite facing upward</strong>, and put the pen down. Then try <code>tree1 size 50</code>. You should get a result something like this: <br>
	</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/tree-level1-BYOB.jpg" alt="" title="" >

		<p>
			3. Make a <code>tree2</code> block that draws two levels. Actually, you're going to make two different versions of this, so call the first one <code>tree2a</code>.<br>
		</p>
		<img class="center" title="" alt="" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/tree2a.png" >

		<p>
			When run, it should give this result:
			<br>
		</p>
		<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/recur/tree-level2.jpg" alt="" title="" >

		<p>
At this rate you'll never be able to make the beautiful version of the
tree in this century. In the next step, we'll discuss how to simplify
this process. <br>
    </p>
		<p> Before going on, make sure that you can
mentally trace through the code provided. Paying close attention to the
forwards and turns is going to be important to see the big picture and
understand the recursion. <br>
