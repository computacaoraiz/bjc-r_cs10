        <p>
            You may have seen in math classes that it can be useful to compose multiple functions together.
            In computer science, this basically means that we want to take the output of one function and pass
            it into the input of another. Press the dog-eared page button on the top left and click libraries. Click on Iteration, Composition at the very top and import it.
            Now you should have this block:
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/compose.png" alt="compose f and g"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            compose, which does just that. It takes in two functions, <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> and returns the
            function <code>f(g)</code>. For example, this
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/compose-mult-add.png" alt="compose (2 * _) and (6 + _)"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            will return a function that is equivalent to
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/mult-add-block.png" alt="2 * (6 + _)"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            For example
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/call-compose-mult-add.png" alt="call 2 * (6 + _) with inputs 3"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            will return <code>18</code> (the result of the calculation <code>2 * (6 + 3)</code>). Notice that when we <code>call</code>ed
            the result of <code>compose</code>, we didn't use
            a gray border. To do this, you can right click compose and click "unringify". This is because <code>compose</code> already returns a function.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now try writing
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/compose-from-list.png" alt="compose-from-list functions"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            which returns the result of composing the functions in the input list, from left to right. So, when called like this
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/compose-from-list-add-sqrt-mult.png" alt="compose-from-list ((_+2), sqrt(_), (10*_))"/>
        </p>

        <p>
            a function equivalent to this
        </p>

        <p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/mult-add-sqrt.png" alt=""/>
        </p>

        <p>
            will be returned.
        </p>

       <!-- <p>
            If you have extra time, edit the <code>compose</code> block and see if you can understand how it's implemented.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <i>Hint: If you edit <code>combine</code> you'll notice that it works from right-to-left, starting with the last two items of a list.</i><br />
            For example
        </p>
            <img src="../../../../img/hof/combine-implementation-example.png" alt="combine with (_+_) items of (1,2,3,4)"/>
        <p>
            will be evaluated as (1 + (2 + (3 + 4))), not (((1 + 2) + 3) + 4).<br />
            Keep this in mind when implementing <code>compose-from-list</code>.
