  <b>The autograder contains hidden tests to ensure students do not hardcode their code to pass the tests.</b>
  To receive full credit, open the starter code and click on the Autograder pallete in the top left area of Snap. 
  Once you have finished coding the above blocks, click on the "run autograder" block. This will run the
  tests for each block locally. If you pass each test locally and did not hardcode your code to pass the tests,
  you should also receive full credit for your Gradescope submission.

            Let's play a number-guessing game (you have already <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/conditionals/number-guessing-game-v2-0.html">seen this before</a>). &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Between your partner and yourself, decide who
            will be the <i>guesser</i> and the the <i>picker</i>.

            The picker chooses a number between 1 and 50, privately.
            The guesser's role is to determine what the number is, and
            to that end asks the picker questions with the only possible answers
            being "yes" or "no".
        </p>
        <p>
            The guesser should try two different
            strategies to playing this game:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <u>Guessing in sequence</u>: "Is the number 1?",
                "Is the number 2?", "Is the number 3?", and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <u>Guessing halfway</u>: You know the number must be between 1 and 50, so you
                start off by asking "Is the number greater than 25?". If the
                answer is "yes", you instantly know that it must be between 26 and 50,
                so you ask "Is the number greater than 37?" (that is, halfway between
                26 and 50).
                <br>
                <br>
                If the answer to the original question
                was no, the number must
                be between 1 and 25, so you ask "Is the number greater than 12?"
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Play several times.  The picker should
            pick a wide variety of numbers, while the guesser should
            use each strategy
            alternately.
        </p>
        <p class="alert quoteGreen">
            As you play each game, think about the ways in which one
            strategy is better than the other.  Which strategy would be better if, say,
            the guessing game involved numbers from 1 to 1000?  From 1 to a
            million?  From 1 to 3?
            <br><br>
            Are there other strategies you can think of?</p>
