			We will now see an example where the runtime of an algorithm really does make a difference.
			Remember the game you played with young Gauss at the beginning of lab?
			We will implement the game in Snap<em>!</em> .
		</p>
		<p>
			<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/algorithms/timing/all-the-numbers-all-the-time.html">Earlier in the lab</a>,
			you made a block that inserts all numbers from <code>1</code> and <code>max</code> into <code>numbers</code>.
			In the <code>Variables</code> menu, you will see two blocks:
		</p>
		<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
			<b>In the starter code, fill in these required blocks:</b>
			<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<img  src="../../../../img/algorithms/non-gauss-add.png" alt="Non-Gaussian add ()"/>
					<ul>
						<li>
							You must use either iteration or HOFs. The solution must run in <code>O(N)</code> time.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>			<img src="../../../../img/algorithms/gaussian-add.png" alt="Gaussian add ()"/>
					<ul>
						<li>The autograder will fail if HOFs or Iteration are used. The solution must run in <code>O(1)</code> time.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br />

			<!-- <img style="width: 241px; height: 61px;" alt="add all numbers in list" src="../../../../img/list/add-numbers-to-list-blocks.png" > -->
		</div>
		<p>
			The first block sums up the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list the normal, "non-Gauss" way:
			walking through the list and adding the numbers one by one.
			The second block sums up the numbers the "Gauss" way: using the formula <code>(N + 1) * N/2</code>, where,
			in this case, <code>N</code> is the same as <code>max</code>.
			(<a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/algorithms/competing-with-young-gauss.html">How did we get this formula?</a>)
			Complete the bodies of these blocks.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you are done, drag the "non-Gauss" block onto the stage and place it immediately after the
			<code>insert all numbers between x and y into numbers</code> block. Also, move the <code>reset timer</code> block <em>after</em> 
			the <code>insert all numbers between x and y into numbers</code> block, since we only need to time how long the "non-Gauss"
			block takes to sum the numbers in the <code>numbers</code> list.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, run the script with <code>max</code> set to <code>10</code>. Again, run it a few times to
			get an idea of the average time the computer takes to sum the numbers up.
			Repeat the experiment with <code>max</code> set to <code>20</code>, <code>40</code>,
			<code>100</code>, and <code>1000</code>. Based on your observations, what kind of
			runtime does the "non-Gauss" block have: constant,
			linear, or neither? Why do you think this is the case?
		</p>
		<p>
			Replace the "non-Gauss" block with the "Gauss" block.
			Once more, run the script with <code>max</code> set to <code>10</code>.
			Again, run it a few times to get an idea of the average time the
			computer takes to sum the numbers up. Repeat the experiment with
			<code>max</code> set to <code>20</code>, <code>40</code>, <code>100</code>, and <code>1000</code>.
			Based on your observations, what kind of runtime does the
			"Gauss" block have: constant, linear, or neither?
			Why do you think this is the case?
