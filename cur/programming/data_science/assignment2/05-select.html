        <p>
            The <code>SELECT</code> block is a block we can use to get a new Table containing only a small number of columns
            from the original Table. If you only need a few columns from a Table to do additional work, the <code>SELECT</code>
            block can eliminate columns you don't need.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Table that results from a <code>SELECT</code> block call has <b>at most the same number of columns</b>
            (if you selected every column), but <b>typically fewer columns</b> than the original table, and it will also
            have the <b>same number of rows</b> as the original Table. The order of the columns in the new Table will be
            the same as their order in the original Table, just with the unselected columns omitted.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <code>SELECT</code> block takes in 2 arguments. These arguments are:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> A list of column names or indexes to select (you can include both, but we recommend using only names or only indexes) </li>
            <li> A Table </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            To see an example of the <code>SELECT</code> block in use, we will try to answer the question
            <b>How much do taxis charge per mile on average?</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To calculate the per mile rate for these taxis, we need the fare and distance data.
            To see only the <code>fare</code> and <code>distance</code> columns of the 
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data.png" alt="Taxi data" style="width:7%"> Table,
            we can use the following query:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data-selected.png" alt="Fare and Distance" style="width:80%">
        </div>

        <p>
            Using the <code>SELECT</code> block, we can make seeing the data we want easier by only focusing on the columns
            we want to see. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we have the columns we want, we can answer our question about the average per mile rate for these taxis.
        </p>

        </div>

        <ol>
            <b>Practice Questions:</b><br>
            <li>
                Using the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/data/coasters-2015.csv" download>coasters-2015.csv</a>, display the name and park of all roller coasters with wood tracks. 
            </li>
            <li>
                What is your favorite thing about roller coasters? The height? The speed? The duration? Turning upside down? Display the roller coasters and your preferred attribute(s), filtered by the qualities you enjoy. 
                Order them by how much you would prefer them. (If you hate roller coasters, display the ones you might be able to tolerate.)
