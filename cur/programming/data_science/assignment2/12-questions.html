        <p>
            For some of these practice questions, we will be using the entirety of the <code>taxis</code> dataset instead of the truncated 8-row version we have been working with
            so far in this lab. This dataset has 6432 rows and has the same 18 columns as the dataset you have seen before.
            You can click <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/data/taxi_data_large.csv" download> this link</a> to download the larger taxis dataset, and you can practice
            importing a Table from a <b>.csv</b> file by loading it into a DASIS Snap<em>!</em> file. the starter file has a variable,
            <code>taxi_data_large</code>, that you can use, but feel free to use any variable name you like if you are not using the starter code file.
            Some of these questions may use other datasets that will be linked in the question. You may need to download these datasets if you did not use them for earlier questions in this module. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have loaded the large taxi dataset into Snap<em>!</em>, you can begin to answer these questions.
            To answer each of these questions, you may use any of the DASIS blocks we have covered so far in the first 2 assignments. Some questions may be able to be answered using
            several different combinations of querying blocks, but any way you can concisely arrive at the answer to the question is acceptable.
        </p>
        

        <ol>
            <li>
                What percentage of all payments were made with a credit card?
            </li>

            <li>
                How many rides were between 2 and 3 <b>kilometers</b> long?
                (Hint: write a helper predicate <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/val-between-n-n+1.png" alt="Value betwen n and n+1 block" style="width:20%"/>
                that returns True when a value is between <code>n</code> and <code>n</code>+1 and False otherwise to avoid having to use 2 consecutive calls to the
                same query block). Similar to the earlier task involving miles and kilometers from this assignment, relabel the <code>distance</code> column to
                <code>distance (mi)</code>.
            </li>

            <li>
                What was the average distance traveled by the 50 longest rides (longest in distance, not duration)?
            </li>

            <li>
                How many taxi rides occurred in pickup zones that began with the letter <b>m</b>?
            </li>

            <li>
                How many taxi rides had the maximum number of passengers in the dataset?
            </li>

            <li>
                Using the <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/data/coasters-2015.csv" download>coasters-2015.csv</a>, 
                do you think there is a relationship between roller coaster track material and the speed of the roller coaster? 
                Use the data and the blocks youâ€™ve learned to justify your answer.
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            A quick note on errors: if you are using a DASIS block and you receive an error, try to walk through your whole query to ensure you are using each block
            correctly and providing correct arguments to blocks. Sometimes the best way to debug is to follow the arguments to your different functions and see if one is
            receiving an argument it shouldn't. Debugging is always part of the programming process, so don't get discouraged if it takes a bit of time to find a bug.
