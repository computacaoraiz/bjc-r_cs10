        <p>
            Now that we've worked with a Table we created for a bit, you may be finding that working with
            data sets any larger than a few rows and columns will start to become more time consuming to enter in
            by hand. Luckily, we have a way to bypass the manual input by <b>importing a file</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            A file is just a way to store data. You may have seen files on your computer before, but their actual contents
            were not as important. Now, we are interested in seeing how a <b>CSV</b> file can help us solve our input problem.
            A <b>.csv</b> tag at the end of a filename means that the information stored in the file is separated by commas.
            Why or how it works is not as important, but what you do need to know is that you can import and even store a Table
            in this file format. When you see <b>.csv</b>, think <b>Table</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The process of importing a Table in Snap<em>!</em> requires:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> A <b>.csv</b> file that contains Table data </li>
            <li> A global variable for you to store that data in (in this lab, we use <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data.png" alt="taxi_data" style="width:10%"/>) </li>
            <li> That global variable to be shown on the stage (by clicking the little check box next to it in the toolbar on the left of the screen) </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            In this assignment, you will be using
            <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/data/taxi_data.csv" download> this CSV file </a>.
            Click the link to download the file onto your computer, and it should show up in your Downloads.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have all those things, you can follow these steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <b>Try it yourself:</b><br>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You should see your new global variable, <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data.png" alt="taxi_data" style="width:7%"/> in the stage.
                    Right click the variable on the stage to find the <b>import</b> option:
                </p>
        
                <div class="center">
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/import.gif" alt="Import Option" style="width:30%"/>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li> Select the <b>.csv</b> file from your computer </li>
            <li> 
                Set the global variable to a new Table Object using <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/create-from-file.png" alt="Create from file block" style="width:40%"/>.
                This will overwrite the raw table you imported and replace it with a DASIS Table object, which is what we want.
                <p class="alert quoteGreen">
                    This version of the <code>CREATE Table Object</code> block assumes that the <b>.csv</b> file you provide has column names already. This is the case with most
                    existing data sets, but if you ever want to use a <b>.csv</b> file that has no column names, you can use
                    <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/create-from-file-no-cols.png" alt="Create from file with no columns block" style="width:40%"/>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            If you did everything right, this should be what is stored in your <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/taxi-data.png" alt="taxi_data" style="width:7%"/> variable:
        </p>

        <div class="center">
            <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/correct-import.png" alt="Correct taxi_data" style="width:60%"/>
        </div>
