        <p>
            For these practice questions, we will be using several new datasets. 
            You can click <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/data/cholesterol-and-smoking.csv" download> this link</a> to download the cholesterol-and-smoking dataset,
            and <a href="/bjc-r/cur/programming/data_science/data/music-library.csv" download> this link</a> to download the music-library dataset.
            You can practice importing a Table from a <b>.csv</b> file by loading it into a DASIS Snap<em>!</em> file. You will have to create a variable to load these files into. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you have loaded the datasets into Snap<em>!</em>, you can begin to answer these questions.
            To answer each of these questions, you may use any of the DASIS blocks we have covered so far in this assignment, and any mentioned on this page. 
            If you would like to play around with this data and explore other blocks, go for it!
        </p>
        

        <ol>
            <li>
                The <code>cholesterol-and-smoking.csv</code> shows cholesterol levels for smokers and ex-smokers from a study. 
                Compare the average cholesterol levels of smokers and non-smokers. What is the difference between these values and what does this suggest about the two populations?
            </li>

            <li>
                How many participants are there in each population in the cholesterol study? Do you think this might have affected the outcome of this study?
            </li>

            <li>
                The <code>music-library.csv</code> is a table of data gathered from students on how many songs they have in their music library. 
                Using the music library, find how many students were surveyed and the average number of songs they have. 
            </li>

            <li>
                Use the following block to display the data from the table:
                <img src="/bjc-r/img/data-science/histogram-of-library-songs.png" alt="Distribution of number of songs in music library" style="width:20%"/>
                that displays the distribution of the number of songs in each student's music library. What trends do you notice about this data? 
                Is there other information you would like to know about this data?
            </li>

        </ol>

        <p class="alert quoteOrange">
            A quick note on errors: if you are using a DASIS block and you receive an error, try to walk through your whole query to ensure you are using each block
            correctly and providing correct arguments to blocks. Sometimes the best way to debug is to follow the arguments to your different functions and see if one is
            receiving an argument it shouldn't. Debugging is always part of the programming process, so don't get discouraged if it takes a bit of time to find a bug.
