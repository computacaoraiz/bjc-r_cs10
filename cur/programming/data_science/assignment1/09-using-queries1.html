            Data Science is all about asking questions and answering them with data. Though we will cover many more Table methods
            in the future, we can already answer meaningful questions about data! Let's take a look at an example of a question we
            can already answer using the blocks we have talked about thus far.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <b>Try exploring this question yourself:</b><br>
            <b>How many total passengers rode in these taxi rides?</b>
        </ol>

        <p>
            It may be easiest to first think about how you would answer this question without any code at all. We could look at the column that
            stores that data, in this case the <code>passengers</code> column, and add up all the numbers there. Doing it this way, we calculate the
            answer to be <code>3 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we know what kind of approach we want to take, we can think about how to do it in Snap<em>!</em>. First, we can think about how
            to get all the numbers in the <code>passengers</code> column...
