<p>Play around with the script first: <code><a href="../../../../prog/Snap/SubsetRace.xml" target="_blank" download>Race</a></code>.</p>


<p>The answer is: all the permutations of a,b,c where all three letters
are present (there are six of them) + all the permutations of a,b,c
where only two letters are present (also six of these) + all the
permutations of a,b,c where only one letter is present (three
possibilities) for a total of fifteen possibilities.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If all three letters are present, it is as if we were deterministic (didn't have random wait times).
      Here is one way we could end up with three letters (for this example order, all 6 permutations
      are possible = {abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, bca}):
      <ul>
        <li>result starts empty</li>
        <li>a, b, and c all clear result.</li>
				<li>a reads result (), joins its a, result is now a.</li>
        <li>b reads result (a), joins its b, result is now ab.</li>
        <li>c reads result (ab), joins its c, result is now abc.</li>
        <li>finish is abc</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If
only two letters were present, we had a race condition. Here is one way
it could happen (again, all 6 combinations and permutations are
possible = {ab, ba, ac, ca, bc, cb}): <ul>
        <li>result starts empty</li>
        <li>a clears result ()</li>
        <li>a reads result (), joins its a, result is now a.</li>
        <li>b and c clear result.</li>
        <li>b reads result (), joins its b, result is now b.</li>
				<li>c reads result (b), joins its c, result is now bc.</li>
        <li>finish is bc</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If
only one number was present, we also had a race condition, and here is
how it could happen (again, all permutations possible = {a, b, c}): <ul>
        <li>result starts empty</li>
        <li>a, b clear result.</li>
				<li>a reads result (), joins its a, result is now a.</li>
        <li>b reads result (a), joins its b, result is now b.</li>
        <li>c clears result.</li>
				<li>c reads result (), joins its c, result is now c.</li>
        <li>finish is c</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
