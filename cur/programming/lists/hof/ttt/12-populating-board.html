<p>Remember the board type we made? Let's start using it to store information.</p>
<p>What is involved in putting something on our board? We need to do TWO things in this block: (a) set an item on the board itself, and (b) display the change. Let's write <code>create (object) at (row) (col)</code>, which will do both of these things for us. We have several objects that we want to be able to place on the board; check out the costumes to see the different options.</p>
<p>You'll find these blocks helpful:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-setter.png" alt="board setter block" /></p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-go-to-row-col.png" alt="go to row, col on display block" /></p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/switch-costume.png" alt="switch costume block" /></p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/stamp.png" alt="stamp block" /></p>
<p>(Hint: the idea behind displaying our object is that we should first go to the correct square, switch to the correct costume, and stamp)</p>
<p>(Another hint: You can pass variables into the costumes block!)</p>
<p>Alright, head to the next page when you think you have your answer.</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Write the <code>create (object) at (row) (col)</code> block as described. If you want to test your block before moving on, write the name of the costume in place of <code>(object)</code> in <code>create (object) at (row) (col)</code>.</p>
