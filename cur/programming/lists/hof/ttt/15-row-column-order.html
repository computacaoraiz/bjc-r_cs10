<p>Row-major order and column-major order are methods used for
     storing multi-dimensional arrays in linear, one-dimensional memory spaces like RAM. 
     The choice between row-major order and column-major order can impact performance depending 
     on the nature of the operations being performed on the array. Here are some considerations
      and reasons for using row-major order: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>In some programming languages like C and C++, arrays are stored in 
            row-major order by default. Sticking with the default can make code more 
            straightforward and easier to understand, especially for others who might be 
            reading or maintaining your code.
        </li>
        <li>
            Modern processors use caches to reduce the average time to access memory.
             When data is accessed in memory, nearby data is often also loaded into
              cache in anticipation of future accesses. Because of this, accessing 
              elements that are nearby in memory (such as elements within the same 
              row of a row-major order array) can be much faster than accessing elements
               that are farther away in memory (such as elements in different rows).
                If your algorithms access array elements in a row-by-row manner, 
                then using row-major order can significantly improve cache 
                performance and overall speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
<p>The way we represent a 2D board is through a list of lists. For example: <br /> <img src="/bjc-r/img/row-column-order/example.png" /> has 3 rows and 3 columns.</p>

<p> We want to flatten a 2D list into a 1D array in two different ways: row-major order (rmo) and column-major order (cmo).
<img class="image-border" src="/bjc-r/img/row-column-order/order.png" alt="Row-Major and Column-Major Order" title="Row-Major and Column-Major Order" width="300" />
<img class="image-border" src="/bjc-r/img/row-column-order/row_column_order_wiki.png" alt="Row-Major and Column-Major Order" title="Row-Major and Column-Major Order" width="300" />
    TODO: Implement the <code>RMO of board</code> block. The input is a 2D board of size NxN (N rows, N columns). 
    The output is a 1D list in row-major order.
    <img class="image-border" src="/bjc-r/img/list/rmo.png" alt="Row-Major Order" title="RMO of (board)" width="300" />

    <img class="image-border" src="/bjc-r/img/row-column-order/rmo_example.png" alt="RMO test case" title="RMO test case" />

    Then, implement the <code>CMO of board</code> block. The input is a 2D board of size NxN (N rows, N columns).
    The output is a 1D list in column-major order.

    <img class="image-border" src="/bjc-r/img/list/cmo.png" alt="Column-Major Order" title="CMO of (board)" width="300" />

    <img class="image-border" src="/bjc-r/img/row-column-order/cmo_example.png" alt="CMO test case" title="CMO test case" />

  </p>

<p>Consider how would our <code>set () () of board</code> and <code>item () () of board</code> blocks change if we decided to group coordinates by column instead?</p>
