<p>Let's start using our board right away! Here's a thought- wouldn't it be cool to be able to draw our board on the stage, and be able to click on squares and use the clicked (row, column) pairs in our code? Imagine, we could build a chess game where you can actually drag the pieces; we could make battleship where we get to place ships on the board with the mouse... there are tons of fun things we could make.</p>
<p>So first thing's first, we need to actually draw the board. Abstraction is key to programming, so we should write our code such that we can draw <em>any</em> size board!</p>
<p>Let's define some global variables that we should keep track of and use:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-global-size.png" alt="size global" /></p>
<p><code>Size</code> will define how many tiles per side our board has.</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-global-start.png" alt="start global" /></p>
<p><code>Start</code> will define where we want to start drawing our board from.</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-global-step.png" alt="step global" /></p>
<p><code>Step</code> will define how wide our tiles are when we draw them.</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-global-displaywidth.png" alt="display width global" /></p>
<p><code>Display width</code> length of one side of the board</p>
<p>The idea here is that our board should be general enough that we can change the size and number of tiles any time we want. If we want our board to always be centered, no matter what value we use for <code>Display width</code>, then what should <code>Start</code> be? If you think about it, if our display width is some number W, then our Start should always be the coordinate (x: -W/2, y: W/2). Determine for yourself where the other corners of the board will be if the top-left is at (x: -W/2, y: W/2) and the display width of the board is W.</p>
<p>How big should the <code>Step</code>, a.k.a. the width and height of the tiles be? We know that the board is going to be <code>Display width</code>x<code>Display width</code> units on the screen. If we want <code>Size</code> tiles to fit in each direction, then they should each be <code>Display width / Size</code> units.</p>
<p>Now that we've set <code>Step</code> to work with any <code>Size</code>, we can set <code>Size</code> to however large we'd like! Let's try 8 for now. While we're at it, let's create and store our board.</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/board-set-globals.png" alt="setting the board globals" /></p>
<p>So that's everything we really need to start drawing the board. <code>Draw Square Board</code> is a basic block that draws the borders of our new board according to the global variables we just defined! Try changing the <code>Size</code> variable.</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Make sure you understand how the variables we created interact with and depend on each other. This math is important and allows us to make any sized board, with any width, centered automatically for us.</p>
</div>
<h3>Turning Clicks Into (Row, Column)</h3>
<p>For this portion, we'll use a bit of math to convert the (mouse x, mouse y) coordinates of our clicks into (row, column) coordinates on our board. The following chunks of code have been written for you in the starter file, but make sure you understand them before moving on.</p>
<p>Here is how we can convert <code>mouse x</code> into <code>column</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/find-col.png" alt="math to find column from mouse x" /></p>
<p>Here is how we can convert <code>mouse y</code> into <code>row</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/find-row.png" alt="math to find row from mouse y" /></p>
<p>Let's put it all together to get a functioning click detector!</p>
<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/click-detect-basic.png" alt="basic functioning click detector" /></p>
<p>Try clicking on a few spots outside of the board. What coordinates do we get? Does this make sense?</p>
<p>Let's make it so that our click-detecting script doesn't fire when we click outside of the display board. Remember the (x, y) bounds of our board from earlier? Write the <code>Inside Board (x) (y)</code> predicate function that reports whether the given x and y coordinates are inside the board. Note: we're going to be passing <code>mouse x</code> and <code>mouse y</code> coordinates to this block.</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Write the <code>inside board</code> block as described.</p>
</div>
<p>Once you have that ready, put them together like this to finish off our neat click detector.</p>
