<h3> Can the Computer Win on this Move? </h3>
<p>Now that we can find the status of all the winning triples we can use this information to find a winning move for the computer. You'll begin by building the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/
winning-triple-for-player.png" width="30%" height="30%" /> block to identify the contents of the triple on the board where the player could win on their next turn. Then, you'll fill in <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/
winning-square.png" width="30%" height="30%" />, which will select the correct position out of that triple.

<p style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/winning-triple-example.png" width="50%" height="50%"/>
</p>

<p>
	The block above takes in a board and an "x" or "o" representing the player we are trying to find a winning triple for. It outputs the first triple that contains a winning space for the given player. To find this triple look for a triple in which our letter appears twice and the other letter doesn't appear at all.
</p>

<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
    <p>Hint: Use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/satus-of-all-triples.png" width="20%" height="20%"/> block you just created and go through the triples to find an instance where the current player appears 2 times and their opponent appears 0 times. We have also provided the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/opponent.png" width="12%" height="12%"/> block and the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/appearances-block.png" alt="" title="There should be an image here" width="20%" height="20%" border="0" /> block to help you.</p>
  </div>
<p>
<img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/
winning-square-example.png" width="40%" height="50%" />
</p>
	The block above takes in a player (X or O) and a board, and outputs the square that player should put their piece in to win the game. Remember to account for the case in which there is aren't any winning squares for the given player. <b>If there are no winning squares, report -1</b>.
</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
    <p>Hint: You may find the  <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/
	winning-triple-for-player.png" width="30%" height="30%" /> block useful here.</p>
 </div>

 <h3> Putting it all together </h3>

At this point you're ready to assemble the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-for-computer.png" alt="list of winning combinations" width="20%" height="20%"/> block (you'll need to remove our current definition):
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-comp-code.png" alt="next move for computer block with winning-square rule" width="40%" height="40%"/></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Remember your block should do the following:


<ul>
    <li>Rule 1: If the computer can win; do so.</li>
    <li>Rule 2: If my opponent (the human player) can win; block them.</li>
    <li>Final rule: Otherwise, just pick the best empty square.</li>
  </ul>

 </p>

Here is some oversimplified code that roughly represents what your block should look like. 

<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-for-comp-psuedo.png" alt="next move for computer block with winning-square rule" width="50%" height="50%"/></p>
</blockquote>

<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
    <p>
      Hint: "Computer can win on this move" and "Human can win on this move" have already been implemented! Just make sure you include the proper inputs so that it functions properly.
    </p>
  </div>

Your implementation should use the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/winning-square.png" width="30%" height="30%" /> block we made above. Try to make your implementation as readable as possible by abstracting away sections of your code. You can implement the final rule by:
<ol>
<li>Picking a random spot in situations where there's no immediate win or opponent to block</li>
  <li>Prioritizing the middle, then corners, then edges, or</li>
  <li>implementing some more advanced tic-tac-toe strategies, if you're a tic-tac-toe buff and up for a challenge! (ever heard of 'forks'?)</li>
</ol>

  Once you finish implementing the <img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/next-move-for-computer.png" alt="list of winning combinations" width="20%" height="20%"/> block, you're done with this lab! You can click the green flag to play tic-tac-toe against the computer strategy you defined.

</blockquote>
<p>But that's an oversimplified picture just so you understand the important parts before we add the bookkeeping. Each of the reporters and predicates shown above (except the last, all-else-fails rule) will need two inputs: the list of triples and the computer's letter (X or O).  So here's a more realistic picture:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/better-ttt.png" alt="ttt with inputs to helpers" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the clearest way to express the process that <code>ttt</code> must follow to try several &quot;if <em>this </em>then do <em>that</em>&quot; rules in sequence. It's a bit inefficient, though, because the computation to answer the blue yes-or-no questions above is basically to look for an answer to the green which-square question below it, and then report <code>true</code> if a square is found. So we end up doing those computations twice. Instead, we'll combine the yes-or-no computation and the which-square computation by writing rule procedures that report a square number if one is found, or <code>false</code> if not. Then the code in <code>ttt</code> for each rule becomes</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/ttt-rule-fragment.png" alt="fragment of ttt for one rule using temp variable" /></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Okay, time to move from planning to doing. The next goal is to build a <code>winning square</code> block. It'll take a list of triples and an X-or-O, and look for a square in which that player can move to win immediately. What does that mean in terms the program can understand? (We asked you to think about this a few screens ago.) Our answer is, &quot;look for a winning combination in which our letter appears twice and the other letter doesn't appear at all.&quot; So we seem to need two helpers: one that reports how many times a letter appears in a triple, and one that reports &quot;the other letter.&quot;</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
	<p>Start by looking for a reporter called <code>opponent</code> that just takes an <code>X</code> or <code>O</code> as its input, and reports the other letter.<br />
</div>
Now make a helper block called <code>appearances</code> that takes a word and a list as inputs, and  returns the number of times the first one appears in the second. Hint: Use a higher order function.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><img src="/bjc-r/img/hof/appearances-block.png" alt="" title="There should be an image here" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Write the <code>appearances </code> block as defined above. Definitely use the given hint; this block can be really short!</p>
</div>
<p>Now write a <code>winning square</code> block that uses a higher order function to select those triples in which our letter appears twice and the opponent's letter doesn't appear at all, and then if any such triples are found, report the number of the vacant square in the first such triple; if not, report <code>false</code>.</p>
<div class="alert quoteGreen alert-success">
  <p>Write the <code>winning square</code> block as defined above.</p>
</div> -->
