        <h3>What is random.seed?</h3>
        <p>
            The `random.seed` function is a method provided by the Python `random` library that initializes the random number generator.
            Using `random.seed` guarantees that the same sequence of numbers will appear every time you run your code. This is particularly
            useful for debugging and for scenarios where you need consistent results, like in automated tests or simulations.
        </p>
        <h3>Using random.seed</h3>
        <p>
            To use `random.seed`, simply call the function at the beginning of your script. You can pass it any hashable object, and the same
            seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers. Here's a simple example of how to use `random.seed`:
        </p>
        <p><pre><code>
# Import the random library
import random

# Initialize the random number generator with a seed
random.seed(42)

# Generate three random numbers
print(random.random())
print(random.random())
print(random.random())

# Re-seed the generator
random.seed(42)

# Generate three random numbers again
print(random.random())
print(random.random())
print(random.random())
        </code></pre></p>
        <p>
            In this example, you will notice that the first set of three random numbers is identical to the second set.
            This is because we used the same seed value (`42`) before each set. Without setting the seed, the numbers
            would have been different each time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try experimenting with different seed values and functions from the `random` library to see how they work together.
