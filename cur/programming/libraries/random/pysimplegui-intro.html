        <h2>Introduction to PySimpleGUI</h2>
        <p>
            PySimpleGUI is a Python library designed to make the creation of graphical user interfaces (GUI) quick and accessible to beginners.
            It wraps tkinter, Qt, WxPython, and Remi in a single, well-documented API that allows for simpler GUI creation using the Python programming language.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Creating a Simple Popup Menu with PySimpleGUI</h3>
        <p>
            One of the simplest yet most useful features in PySimpleGUI is the popup window. Popups can be used to display messages, ask for user input, or provide simple interactions. Here’s how you can create a basic popup menu:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
import PySimpleGUI as sg

# Simple popup
sg.popup('Hello World!', 'This is a simple popup menu.')
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            When you run this code, it will display a popup window with the text "Hello World!" and a subtext "This is a simple popup menu." with an OK button to close it.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Installing PySimpleGUI</h3>
        <p>
            Before you can use PySimpleGUI, you need to install it. If you have pip installed, you can easily install PySimpleGUI by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
pip install PySimpleGUI
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            After installation, you can import PySimpleGUI in your Python script and start creating your GUIs.
        </p>

        Here are examples of what is possible with PySimpleGUI:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Pong</a>. According to Wikipedia, 
                Pong is a table tennis-themed 
                twitch arcade sports video game, 
                featuring simple two-dimensional graphics,
                manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.
                Pong was the first commercially successful video game,
                and it helped to establish the video game industry
                along with the Magnavox Odyssey.

                <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/blob/master/DemoPrograms/Demo_Dashboard.py">Custom Dashboard</a>
                Dashboards provide a more user-friendly way to interact with complex data and systems. nteractive elements in a dashboard 
                can make a project more engaging, allowing users to manipulate data or control parameters and see the effects in real-time.
                PySimpleGUI offers a straightforward way to create custom GUIs quickly.

                <a href="https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI-YOLO/blob/master/yolo_video.py">Computer Vision</a>
                Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand 
                the visual world. Using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines 
                can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

                This particular system is using an object detection algorithm (YOLO - You Only Look Once) to
                 identify and locate vehicles in the video. It provides bounding boxes around each detected vehicle 
                 and includes a confidence score that indicates the algorithm's certainty that the identified object 
                 is a vehicle. The confidence score is a probability between 0 and 1, with numbers closer to 1 indicating higher confidence.
