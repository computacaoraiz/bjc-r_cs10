<h3>
    Libraries and Extensions
</h3>
<p>
    Wikipedia defines <b>libraries</b> as "a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, 
    often for software development". In computer science, libraries are basically any type of tool that 
    add on to the functionality of a programming language. You have already familiarized yourself with many 
    different libraries in CS10. In Snap!, blocks like the "list to sentence" or "sentence to list" blocks 
    are all part of the <b> Word, Sentences </b>library. In Python, you have seen the <b>Turtle </b>library in the first 
    python lab, along with many other libraries in the most recent data science lab.

</div>


<p>
    In Snap!-Programming-Universe (SPU)*, there exists extensions that are built on top of Snap! These extensions
     are similar to libraries, but instead of them being blocks that import directly to Snap!, they have their own 
     set of blocks and interfaces that can be unique to the extension.

    Today you will be exploring different libraries/extensions. While 
    we encourage you to explore all of the modules in this lab,<b> you are only required to receive 2/5 points on the 
    Gradescope conceptual quiz to earn full points on this lab. </b>

    If you are interested in Pygame, you are welcome to check out the <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/"  target="_blank">documentation </a>
    or this resource that was made in 2021 by the old CS10 staff: <a href="https://cs10.org/bjc-r/cur/programming/python/pygame_intro.html?topic=berkeley_bjc%2Fpython%2Fpygame.topic"  target="_blank">Resource</a>. 

    Pygame allows for the development of games that include graphics,
     sound, and music by providing a framework for rendering graphics, handling sounds,
      managing events, and more. It is also used for other types of multimedia applications
       that require graphical display, audio, and user interaction. Pygame is popular 
       for its simplicity and is often recommended for beginners in game development.

    <br/>
    However, please note that the CS10 staff may not be able to help with Pygame debugging or specific features.
