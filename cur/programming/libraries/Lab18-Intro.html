<h3>
    Libraries and Extensions
</h3>
<p>
    Wikipedia defines <b>libraries</b> as "a collection of non-volatile resources used by computer programs, 
    often for software development". In computer science, libraries are basically any type of tool that 
    add on to the functionality of a programming language. You have already familiarized yourself with many 
    different libraries in CS10. In Snap!, blocks like the "list to sentence" or "sentence to list" blocks 
    are all part of the <b> Word, Sentences </b>library. In Python, you have seen the <b>Turtle </b>library in the first 
    python lab, along with many other libraries in the most recent data science lab.

<p>
    In Snap!-Programming-Universe (SPU)*, there exists extensions that are built on top of Snap! These extensions
     are similar to libraries, but instead of them being blocks that import directly to Snap!, they have their own 
     set of blocks and interfaces that can be unique to the extension. 
</p>
<p>
    Today you will be exploring 5 different libraries/extensions, 3 Python libraries and 2 Snap! extensions. While 
    we encourage you to explore all of the modules in this lab, you are only required to complete the exercises for 
    two of Python or Snap! modules. <b>To get credit for the lab, you will only need to answer the check off questions 
    associated with the two modules that you choose to do.</b>
</p>

    Here is a brief overview of the modules and what you will be doing with them:
