        <h1>Hangman Game in Python with PySimpleGUI</h1>
        <h2>Introduction to Hangman</h2>
        <p>
            Hangman is a classic word game where one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by
            suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes,
            representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the
            other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the
            other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating the Game Window</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>create_window</code> function is responsible for setting up the graphical interface of the game.
            Using PySimpleGUI, we create a window layout that includes text elements for the game title, the word to guess,
            and the number of attempts left. There are also buttons for each letter of the alphabet to allow the player
            to choose letters, and additional buttons to start a new game or exit.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
def create_window(game):
    layout = [
        [sg.Text('Hangman Game', font=('Helvetica', 16))],
        [sg.Text('Word:'), sg.Text(' '.join(game.get_display_word()), key='-WORD-')],
        [sg.Text('Attempts left:'), sg.Text(game.get_attempts_left(), key='-ATTEMPTS-')],
        [sg.Button(c, key=c, button_color=('white', 'blue')) for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'],
        [sg.Button('New Game', key='-NEW-'), sg.Button('Exit', key='-EXIT-')]
    ]
    return sg.Window('Hangman', layout)
        </code></pre>

        <h2>The Game Loop</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>while True</code> loop in the <code>play_game</code> function is the main loop of the game, which
            continues to run until the game is over, either because the player has guessed the word or has run out of attempts.
            The loop checks for events, such as button clicks, and updates the game state accordingly.
        </p>

        <h2>Exiting the Game</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>window.close()</code> method is called when the game loop ends, which closes the game window and
            ends the PySimpleGUI program cleanly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can learn how to use GUI elements to interact with Python code, manage application state, and handle
            events in a loop. This knowledge can be applied to many other types of Python projects that require a graphical
            user interface.
