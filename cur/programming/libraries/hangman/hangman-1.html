        <h1>Hangman Game in Python with PySimpleGUI</h1>
        <h2>Introduction to Hangman</h2>
        <p>
            Hangman is a classic word game where one player thinks of a word and the other tries to guess it by
            suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes,
            representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the
            other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the
            other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.
        </p>

        <h2>Creating the Game Window</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>create_window</code> function is responsible for setting up the graphical interface of the game.
            Using PySimpleGUI, we create a window layout that includes text elements for the game title, the word to guess,
            and the number of attempts left. There are also buttons for each letter of the alphabet to allow the player
            to choose letters, and additional buttons to start a new game or exit.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
def create_window(game):
    layout = [
        [sg.Text('Hangman Game', font=('Helvetica', 16))],
        [sg.Text('Word:'), sg.Text(' '.join(game.get_display_word()), key='-WORD-')],
        [sg.Text('Attempts left:'), sg.Text(game.get_attempts_left(), key='-ATTEMPTS-')],
        [sg.Button(c, key=c, button_color=('white', 'blue')) for c in 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'],
        [sg.Button('New Game', key='-NEW-'), sg.Button('Exit', key='-EXIT-')]
    ]
    return sg.Window('Hangman', layout)
        </code></pre>

        <h2>The Game Loop</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>while True</code> loop in the <code>play_game</code> function is the main loop of the game, which
            continues to run until the game is over, either because the player has guessed the word or has run out of attempts.
            The loop checks for events, such as button clicks, and updates the game state accordingly.
        </p>

        <h2>Exiting the Game</h2>
        <p>
            The <code>window.close()</code> method is called when the game loop ends, which closes the game window and
            ends the PySimpleGUI program cleanly.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You can learn how to use GUI elements to interact with Python code, manage application state, and handle
            events in a loop. This knowledge can be applied to many other types of Python projects that require a graphical
            user interface.
        </p>

        <h1>Window Keys and Element Updating in PySimpleGUI</h1>
        
        <h2>Understanding Window['-ATTEMPTS-'].update()</h2>
        <p>
            In PySimpleGUI, each element in a window can be accessed via a unique identifier known as a "key". This allows for dynamic interaction with the GUI elements. The line of code in question demonstrates how to update an element's content:
        </p>
        <pre><code>window['-ATTEMPTS-'].update(game.get_attempts_left())</code></pre>
        <p>
            This code performs two key actions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Element Selection:</strong> <code>window['-ATTEMPTS-']</code> selects the GUI element with the key <code>'-ATTEMPTS-'</code>. This key is a unique string that identifies a specific element within the window, in this case, a text element displaying the number of attempts left in a game of Hangman.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Content Update:</strong> The <code>.update()</code> method changes the content of the selected element. <code>game.get_attempts_left()</code> calls a method from the <code>HangmanGame</code> class instance to retrieve the current number of attempts left for the player. This value is then used to update the text displayed on the window.
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Role of Window Keys in PySimpleGUI</h2>
        <p>
            A window key in PySimpleGUI is a powerful feature that allows developers to interact with the GUI elements after the window has been created. By assigning a key to an element, developers can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access and modify elements directly without the need for complex queries or maintaining references to the elements.</li>
            <li>Update the GUI in response to user input or other events, ensuring the interface reflects the current state of the application.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            Keys enable the creation of dynamic and responsive GUI applications, making PySimpleGUI an accessible library for both beginners and experienced developers looking to build interactive Python programs.
        </p>

        <h1>Keys in PySimpleGUI vs. Dictionary Keys</h1>

        <h2>Similarities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unique Identifiers:</strong> Both serve as unique identifiers for accessing items.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Patterns:</strong> Both utilize square bracket notation for access.</li>
            <li><strong>Immutability Requirement:</strong> Keys must be immutable types.</li>
        </ul>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Scope</td>
                <td>Specific to PySimpleGUI library.</td>
                <td>Universal in Python, not limited to a specific library.</td>
            </tr>

        <h2>Explaining the GUI Text Element</h2>
    <p>
        In PySimpleGUI, the GUI layout is defined using lists of elements. Each list represents a row in the window, and each element within the list represents a component in that row. Let's break down the following line of code:
    </p>
    <pre><code>[sg.Text('Word:'), sg.Text(' '.join(game.get_display_word()), key='-WORD-')],</code></pre>
    <p>
        This line of code is constructing a row with two text elements for our GUI:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>sg.Text('Word:')</code> creates a static text label that displays the text "Word:" to the user. This acts as a prompt for the dynamic content that follows.</li>
        <li>
            <code>sg.Text(' '.join(game.get_display_word()), key='-WORD-')</code> serves two purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>' '.join(game.get_display_word())</code> takes a list of characters representing the current state of the word to be guessed in the game (with letters still to be guessed shown as underscores) and joins them into a string with spaces. For example, if the word is "apple" and the letters "a" and "p" have been guessed, it would display "a p p _ _".
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <code>key='-WORD-'</code> part assigns a unique identifier to this text element, which allows the GUI to update this element with new content when the game state changes (like when a new letter is guessed correctly).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This setup allows the Hangman game's GUI to display the word to the user with guessed letters revealed and unguessed letters hidden. The unique key enables the program to find and update this specific text element throughout the game.
    </p>
