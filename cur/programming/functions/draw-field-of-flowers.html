            Draw a field of flowers, and give each flower a different color, size, shape, position, and so forth.   
            Use some of the simple custom blocks you've already written, and write new custom blocks 
            that make use of those simpler blocks to do complicated things.
            <br><br>
            Use <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/repeat.png" alt="repeat block">
            to draw lots of flowers, flowers with lots of petals, and so forth.  
            <br><br>
            Use 
            <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/pick-random-empty-args.png" alt="pick random block">
            as much as you can to make the flowers interesting and different.
