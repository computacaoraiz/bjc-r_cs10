	    So far, all of the blocks you've defined have been "command" blocks. These actual carry out an action that
	    affects the state of the program. For example, the <code>move</code> block makes the sprite move, and
	    the <code>say</code> block makes the sprite say something. We call these effects "side effects."
	</p>

	<p>
	    Sometimes, we aren't interested in any side effects, and just want a block that performs a calculation for
	    us. These are called "reporters," because rather than causing the program to do something, they simply give
	    us back a value. Many blocks on the "operators" palette are reporters. Here are just a few:
	</p>

	<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/some-reporters.png" alt="a portion of the 'operators'
	palette"/>

	<p>
	    Notice how all of these are rounded, and can't be attached directly to other blocks. Because of this, we
	    need to use them in combination with other blocks, like <code>say</code> or <code>set</code>. For example:
	</p>

	<img class="center" src="/bjc-r/img/cond/say-4-plus-7.png" alt="say (4 + 7)"/>

	<p>
	    (I'm sure you've been doing things like this since you started using Snap<em>!</em>)
	</p>

	<p>
	    Let's learn how to make our own reporter blocks!
	</p>

	<ol>
	    <li>
		The first step is, as usual, to select "make a block" from the bottom of the "variables" palette.
	    </li>

	    <li>
		Next, we'll select "reporter" rather than the usual "command."
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/make-a-reporter.png" alt="select reporter as block type"/></p>
		Note: you don't have to necessarily put all reporters in the "operators" palette; it's just the most
		frequent place for them.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Once you give your block a name and click "OK," your block definition will look something like this:
		<p><img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/my-first-reporter.png" alt="empty reporter body"/></p> Notice
		that <img class="inline" src="/bjc-r/img/blocks/report.png" alt="report ()"/> has automatically been
		added to the block definition. This is to remind you that all reporter blocks <em>must</em> report a value.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Fill in the body with whatever you want, and you're done!
	    </li>
	</ol>

	<p>
	    Let's take a look at an example:
	</p>

	<img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/square-of-x.png" alt="square(x) block definition"/> 

	<p>
	    This block will take in a parameter <code>x</code>, and report <code>x<sup>2</sup></code>.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Here's a more complex example, using <code>if</code>:
	</p>

	<img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/homemade-abs.png" alt="homemade absolute value block"/>

	<p>
	    This block is a home-made version of the <code>abs</code> (absolute value) block that we saw earlier. Notice
	    that it contains two <code>report</code> blocks. Reporter blocks can have as many <code>report</code>s as
	    you want/need.
	</p>

	<p>
	    Let's try writing our own reporter block! Try writing a <code>max</code> block that takes in two numbers and
	    reports the larger of the two. Hint: you'll need to use <code>if</code>.
	</p>
	<img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/max-block.png" alt="empty max(x, y) block definition"/>

	<p>
	    Here's a more complex block that we wrote. Predict what it will report when run with inputs "hello" and 5.
	</p>
	<img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/join-word-n-times.png" alt="mysterious block definition"/>

	<p>
	    "Predicates" are special kinds of reporter blocks that only report <code>true</code>
	    or <code>false</code>. You'll see in the next slide how to write them.
	</p>

	<p>
		In an earlier section, we created command blocks for traffic signal and letter grade. Now, we are going to
		create a reporter block version of these blocks. Here are the conditions.

		<p>
			Letter Grades:
			<br/>
			-Domain: Number between 0-100
			<br/>
			-Range: Text, a single letter between A-F
			<ul>
				<li>90 - 100 → A</li>
				<li>80 - 89.99 → B</li>
				<li>70 - 79.99 → C</li>
				<li>60 - 69.99 → D</li>
				<li>0 - 59.99 → F</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	 <br/>
	 <p>
		Traffic Signal:
		<br />
		-Domain: Text representing a color 
		<br/>
		-Range: Text representing an action
		<br/>
		<b>Note: Please use the exact text string in your report block for the autograder to work.</b>
		<ul>
			<li>green → Go!</li>
			<li>yellow → Slow</li>
			<li>red → Stop!</li>
		</ul>
	 </p>
		Fill in the following blocks in the starter code:
		<ul>
		<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/letter-grade-reporter.png" alt="letter grade reporter block definition"/></li>
		<li><img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/traffic-signal-reporter.png" alt="traffic signal reporter block definition"></li>
		</ul>

		<br/>
		For example:
		<img src="/bjc-r/img/building-blocks/letter-grade-example.png" alt="letter grade reporter(92.56) == A">
	</p>
