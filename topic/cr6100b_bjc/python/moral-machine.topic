title: Social Implications: Algorithmic Bias and the Moral Machine
{
h2: Big Ideas
big-idea: Algorithms are essential, useful tools in computer science, but can often contain hidden biases.
big-idea: No matter how hard we may try to program objective, unbiased algorithms, our algorithms may contain hidden, unintended biases
big-idea: Biased algorithms and datasets can have major consequences that we as programmers need to be aware of.

h2: Activities
learning-goal: Develop a Python decision-making Algorithm for the Moral Machine
learning-goal: Explore first-hand how algorithmic bias can manifest in data science and machine learning.
learning-goal: Think critically about algorithmic bias, including its possible causes, consequences, and cures.
